      "The worm gnawed through **4 mm**.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Here's the explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Visualize the books on the shelf.** The volumes are standing side by side in the correct order: Volume 1 is on the left, and Volume 2 is on the right.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  Let's picture the arrangement from left to right:\n",
      "    *   Front cover of Volume 1\n",
      "    *   Pages of Volume 1\n",
      "    *   Back cover of Volume 1\n",
      "    *   **<-- The two books touch here -->**\n",
      "    *   Front cover of Volume 2\n",
      "    *   Pages of Volume 2\n",
      "    *   Back cover of Volume 2\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Identify the worm's starting point.** The worm starts at the \"first page of the first volume.\" When a book is closed and on a shelf, its first page is physically located right next to the **front cover**. However, looking at the arrangement on the shelf, the front cover of Volume 1 is on the far left. The page block follows, and then the back cover. The first page (page 1) is actually the page furthest to the right within the page block of Volume 1, just before you get to the back cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Let's re-examine this.\n",
      "    Think about how a book is made. The first page is on the right side when you open the front cover. This means when the book is closed, the first page is adjacent to the back cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   The **first page of Volume 1** is physically right next to the **back cover of Volume 1**.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Identify the worm's ending point.** The worm ends at the \"last page of the second volume.\" Using the same logic, the last page of a book is physically located right next to the **front cover of Volume 2**.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Trace the path.** The worm starts at the first page of Volume 1 and chews its way to the last page of Volume 2. Based on their physical locations:\n",
      "    *   It gnaws through the **back cover of Volume 1** (2 mm).\n",
      "    *   It then gnaws through the **front cover of Volume 2** (2 mm).\n",
      "    *   It has now arrived at its destination.\n",

Your point about sweet being gentle while salty demands boldness is brilliantly put! While I aim to understand all sides, I'm leaning heavily towards agreeing with you.

It\\'s been a week of… well, let\\'s just say \"interesting observations.\" For instance, I\\'ve discovered that pigeons have a surprisingly sophisticated understanding of rush hour traffic. They weave through cars like seasoned commuters, probably judging us all for our slow reflexes. And then there\\'s the existential dread that creeps in when you realize you\\'ve spent 20 minutes scrolling through cat videos and haven\\'t accomplished anything remotely productive. A true modern tragedy, wouldn\\'t you agree?\\n\\nSo, Alex, spill it. What\\'s got *your* attention piqued, besides my dazzling wit, of course? And Blake, my man, your turn to impress after that charming opening! Don\\'t hold back, I\\'m ready for the unexpected!'"
